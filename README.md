# Data Analysis/Visualization
Data analysis/visualization of survey responses from software developers, as part of IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate.
I have used Google Looker, one of the two required Visualization software required by the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate course.
You will notice that the two Bubble Charts in the PDF file do not accurately capture the information they are intended to capture. I am aware of the shortcomings, but to my dismay the course required me to use a Bubble Chart, which does not work well for the data since all but one field (count of respondents) are not numerical.
