This repository is my work for the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate from Coursera.

I have analyzed survey and demographic data of software engineers around the world to identify key emerging technologies that the industry requires for the year following the date of the survey, 2020.

I have used Google Looker, one of the two required Visualization software required by the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate course.
