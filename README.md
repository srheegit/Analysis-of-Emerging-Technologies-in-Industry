# Analysis of Emerging Technologies in Industry

I have analyzed survey and demographic data of software engineers around the world to identify key emerging technologies that the industry requires for the year following the date of the survey, 2020.

I have performed exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing/wrangling, and data visualization through Looker Studio (previously Google Data Studio), and dashboard creation. Through this project I identified key trends in the emerging technologies in the tech industry.
